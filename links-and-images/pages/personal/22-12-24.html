            <p>alvinnguyen@root:$ Do you worry about perfection too? Getting started with projects is sometimes 
                difficult. I'm sure many of you can relate to imposter syndrome. It's tough, isn't 
                it? (Y/n)?</p>

            <p>alvinnguyen@root:$ What's unfortunate is that the imposter syndrome exists in conjunction with 
                overwhelming guilt that I haven't done enough for myself. There's no objective 
                measure for how I should be growing, but it's hard not to see what I'm capable of 
                sometimes and not seeing anything meaningful come out of it. </p>
            
            <p>alvinnguyen@root:$ However, here we are. My year has been filled with ups and downs. I also want to make 
                it clear I know that we all endure our fair share of struggles; it would be unwise 
                and ignorant to think otherwise. Anyway, I've been trying to work on myself--mind and 
                body. It's a bit frustrating at times; I'm stuck feeling like I'm taking on more than 
                I can while not doing enough.</p>
