    <h2>Meta-learning and Operant Conditioning â€¢ Written 22-12-27</h2>
    <p>The concept of learning is a fascinating topic when applied to itself. I would say 
        my interest came from observing the different rates at which players progressed in 
        their skillset during my time playing Melee. The process of learning involves acquiring 
        new information, behaviors, and skills. This information may be learned through 
        experience or observation. Competing in tournaments at a national or even international 
        level requires great amounts of practice in order to master the skills required to compete 
        at the highest levels. During the time that I have spent competing, I have seen many 
        examples of people who seemed to have achieved an amazing amount of skill for the amount 
        of time they have played the game. However, I have also witnessed many examples of people 
        who were not nearly as skilled and seemed to struggle with certain aspects of the game. 
        Trying to understand these differences was a major factor for me in becoming interested 
        in the learning process. 
    </p>

    <p>Through my experience playing and competing in Melee, I would consider operant conditioning 
        to be a major underlying concept in the game. Operant conditioning is the process in which 
        behavior is reinforced by the outcome of that behavior. This occurs through the practice 
        of repetition and reward. This exists in many forms within and outside of the context of 
        Melee, as well. Thanks to the use of GECKO codes, we're able to have a clear negative 
        reinforcement for L-cancelling; characters will flash red when the player has missed an 
        L-cancel. The red indicator is the punishment that is a result of undesirable behavior. 
        Through the use of this punishment (red flash), the player is more likely to avoid 
        undesirable behavior (missing L-cancels) in the future as it is negatively reinforced 
        by receiving the indicator when they are performing this behavior. The addition of the 
        stimulus (red flash) as a punishment to reduce the unwanted behavior (missed L-cancel) 
        is what makes this a negative reinforcement. It also has the beneficial side-effect of 
        increasing the readability for these mistakes during matches which can help identify 
        recurring situations that might need to be addressed to improve a player's play. 
        Essentially, punishments such as these serve to mitigate the existence of a certain 
        behavior. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Positive reinforcement is the addition of a stimulus to increase the likelihood of a 
        behavior. In Melee this can be used to ingrain good or bad habits. Building off of the 
        previous example, the application of L-cancelling techniques enables follow-up combos. 
        These combos enabled by a successful L-cancel serves as the stimuli for reinforcement
        to increase the likelihood of the behavior. Some characters such as Sheik, Peach, and 
        Falcon can be hit by Fox's waveshine up smash combo. By using smash DI, players on the 
        receiving end can alter their trajectory in an attempt to launch a counterattack. In
        lower-level matches, Fox players will think the waveshine up smash combo is safe, and 
        will have this notion challenged as their skill bracket increases. In order to progress,
        the Fox player will then have to seek out the proper adjustments and incorporate new 
        knowledge and technique into their play. Falco players are able to also knowledge-check 
        people with slide-off side-b tactics. Each successive application of this gimmick 
        rewards the Falco player with free damage and oftentimes stage control if the defender 
        does not adjust which acts as the positive reinforcement to further induce the behavior. 
    </p>

    <p>
        However, punishments are not strictly limited to imposing negative consequences on 
        players when they make mistakes. Punishments in the context of operant conditioning 
        means the removal of a stimulus; a negative punishment can exist to promote a behavior. 
        In another example, a trademark of Mango's Falco pressure involved a simple down air -> 
        shine -> fade back down air. The drift on his aerials would often bait a shield grab 
        (unwanted stimulus) and leave him still in range for an immediate whiff punish. 
        Quite simply, it was the removal of this unwanted stimulus that led to the increase 
        in this behavior.

        There will be a number of benchmarks that may be used to indicate whether a player is 
        making progress. The framework for which you perceive the data will influence your 
        interpretation. By developing your mastery in one domain, you can begin asking broader 
        questions with context in another. For example, since my time with Melee I have been 
        able to set a simple framework for approaching fighting games. I target a simple combo 
        based off a move I feel is reliable to build a gameplan around. This notion isn't 
        exclusive to Melee, but that is the point. It, however, is merely the context of my 
        initial experiences and behaviors that shape my future encounters. Melee also shaped 
        my dexterity and skillset which also set the foundation for my execution and practice 
        regimen. Fighting games are predicated on this dance between two or 
        more characters. By focusing on a specific sequence, I can focus my habituation, execution, 
        and understanding of a particular tool thoroughly. I can view a tool with a given framework, 
        ask questions which have observable metrics in the context of whatever I'm learning. 
        Any experiences that may relate are then applied through the context of the current game, 
        and adjusted based on more conditioning to form a new understanding of the topic at hand. 
        "Am I able to hit this move reliably?" "What does this get me?" "Are there effects that 
        aren't apparent at first glance?" "Is there a cost to performing this option?" "What is 
        the opponent's counterplay?" Learning coding, linguistics, etc. this also still applies 
        as long as I understand how to find the underlying information which helps me navigate 
        the feedback loop for developing and removing habits and behaviors. Those past experiences 
        and perspectives also shape the intensity of behaviors due to experience cultivating one's 
        own development and understanding of which reinforcers and punishments to pay attention to.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, it will also be important to be vigilant in interpreting the information correctly. 
        Due to a lack of context, interpreting information based on your perspective without a
        feedback loop to verify the accuracy of information may accumulate poor habits or a flawed
        understanding. This may exist in studying the examples of others, or having others examine
        your data. That's not to say one is incapable of growing independent of outside influence;
        rather, the influx of additional perspectives offers insights from people with unique 
        experiences that differ from your own. The intermingling of these ideas may help one or
        both to cultivate a new understanding which serves to amend the old.
