        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>To those that don't know me, I am a computational linguistics student. 
            To clear a misconception, those that traditionally study linguistics analyze aspects 
            such as phonetics, syntax, morphology, and psycholinguistics. Studying these aspects of 
            language does not necessarily mean one learns to speak or write these languages. </p>

        <p>Now that is established, I have also studied Vietnamese, Mandarin Chinese, and Japanese 
            due to my own interest. Learning languages has been useful in understanding the cultural 
            differences that exist between members of different societies. However, language offers 
            so much more. </p>

        <p>Languages are powerful tools that encapsulate information about the world around us. 
            It's an invaluable resource that has allowed people of the modern era to build upon the 
            foundation that earlier societies established for us. It enables the communication 
            between people. It allows people to create and distribute information. It is an 
            instrument that gives people access to power and money. It is a tool that allows us to 
            make decisions, small and large. Language is the medium through which we make sense of 
            the world around us. It enables us to create the meaning we are given in society. 
            Language is also a way to communicate with ourselves and allows us to connect to our 
            emotions. In my mind, language is without a doubt one of the most important aspects of 
            human society.</p>

        <p>Though I study linguistics, I also have an interest in computer science. The field of 
            computer science is extremely robust; its development has promoted accessibility to 
            information and resources on a worldwide scale. As these technologies evolve, so does 
            the demand for seamless integration between people and machines. To facilitate this 
            integration, corporations have employed Artificial Intelligence and deep learning to 
            process 175 billion parameters and 800 GB of storage in their training.</p>

        <p>Despite this, current language models still suffer from a lack of consistency between the 
            input and output language. Often, there is a disconnect between the literal and implied 
            meaning of a given utterance or sentence. People may have the capacity to identify these 
            disconnects, but often we cannot articulate these ideas. If it were that simple, people 
            would be able to walk around with Google translate attached to their faces and be 
            understood by those around them. Even if this magical device were to somehow work 
            flawlessly, people are also subject to being unable to express themselves with their 
            words properly. </p>

        <p>By finally getting around to developing this website, I'm hoping to record my thoughts 
            and findings on the matter over the years in my journey to understanding the world and 
            the rich information that other people and societies have to offer.</p>
